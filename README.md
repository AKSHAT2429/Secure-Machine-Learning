## Introduction

This repository presents different approaches and implementations aimed at reducing communication costs and enhancing privacy in distributed learning. Distributed learning is crucial for scenarios where data privacy and distributed data sources are involved, making it essential to optimize communication and protect sensitive information.

## Repository Contents

The repository includes the following Jupyter Notebooks and files:

- **`DL_using_AE_in_Non_IID_environment.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook discussing and implementing deep learning using Autoencoders (AE) in a Non-IID (Non-Independently and Identically Distributed) environment.

- **`DL_using_VAE_in_Non_IID_environment.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook focusing on deep learning with Variational Autoencoders (VAE) in a Non-IID environment.

- **`Distributed_Intrusion_Detection_Systems_using_AE.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook explaining and implementing distributed intrusion detection systems using Autoencoders.

- **`Distributed_Learning_using_Auto_Encoders.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook covering distributed learning techniques using Autoencoders.

- **`Hierarchical_Learning_AE+FL.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook that delves into hierarchical learning with Autoencoders and Federated Learning (FL).

- **`LICENSE`**: The license file specifying the terms and conditions for using the repository.

- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the repository and its contents.
